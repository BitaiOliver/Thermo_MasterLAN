# Thermo_MasterLAN
Thermo is an application which is controlling the heating in my brothers house. It is an IoT device which uses Blynk IoT to have web access. Also runs a local TCP server to which the Slave devices can connect and report the temperature from the different rooms of the house. It is built with an ESP8266 and a 4 channel relay module.
